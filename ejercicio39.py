#*Exercise 39: Sound Levels*

#The following table lists the sound level in decibels for several common noises.

#Noise Decibel level (dB)
#Jackhammer 130
#Gas lawnmower 106
#Alarm clock 70
#Quiet room 40

#Write a program that reads a sound level in decibels from the user. If the user
#enters a decibel level that matches one of the noises in the table then your program
#should display a message containing only that noise. If the user enters a number
#of decibels between the noises listed then your program should display a message
#indicating which noises the level is between. Ensure that your program also generates
#reasonable output for a value smaller than the quietest noise in the table, and for a
#value larger than the loudest noise in the table.
